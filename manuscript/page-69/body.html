Listen, it’s not true; no, I am not ruined, and my heir will certainly get something—if he acts as I desire. But, as a matter of fact, I think he would do better not to stay here.... There’s  nothing here to amuse a man of your age, Nicolas; personally I am busy all day long.”</p><p>The Professor might talk as he liked now. Hypocrisy showed itself in every word; he was nothing but a contemptible Tartuffe; he was fair game. I determined not to leave till I had completely satisfied my curiosity. So, interrupting him, I said in a tone of deep dejection:</p><p>“There you are making use of the inheritance business again to make me decide to leave Fonval. You have clearly no trust in me.”</p><p>With a gesture he deprecated the idea. I went on:</p><p>“No, allow me to remain in order that we may renew our acquaintance. We both need to do so.”</p></div> </div>
