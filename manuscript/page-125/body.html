I have often played, you know, on its lawns and among the branches of its trees; it’s a godfather that has dandled me on its knee—like—like you, uncle.”</p><p>“Yes, yes,” said Lerne evasively. “All the same you will soon have had enough of it.”</p><p>“Not at all. The park of Fonval is my earthly paradise.”</p><p>“There you are right. It’s just that,” he said laughingly, “the forbidden tree grows in its inclosure.

Oh, if Adam had only had a mechanical carriage!”</p><p>“But, uncle, there is the labyrinth!”</p></div> </div>
