I told you last night that you would lose your way,” said he in a drawling voice.</p><p>I recognized my villager of Grey-l’Abbaye, and bad temper prevented me answering him.</p><p>“It’s to Fonval you want to go, is it?” he went on.</p><p>I cursed Fonval in some very profane language in which I consigned it and its inhabitants to the Devil.</p><p>“Because,” went on the postman, “if you are going there, I’ll show you the way. I am taking the letters there. But make haste, I have double load to-day; for this is Monday and I don’t come on Sunday.”</p><p>While saying this, he had drawn his letters from his bag, and was arranging them in his hand.</p><p>“Show me that,” I cried sharply, “Yes, that yellow envelope.”</p></div> </div>
