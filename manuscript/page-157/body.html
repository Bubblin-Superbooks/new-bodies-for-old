<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A blessing on the trees which still hide us. Quick.... That drawing-room door which I have left open! Quick! Quick....</p><p>But the fellow did not know he was being  chased. He did not look behind him. His bare feet were hurting him and keeping him back. I am gaining on him....</p><p>He has stopped and is sniffing the breeze; now he is off again; but I have got nearer. He has jumped into the bushes on the left, towards the cliffâ€”so do I. I am only ten yards off, now. He dashes through the brambles without heeding their thorns. I follow in his wake. The branches are lashing at him, and the thorns are hurting him. He is moaning. Well, why does not he thrust them aside? He could easily avoid their clutches. The cliffs are not far away. Now we are making straight for them. On my honor! My quarry seems to know perfectly well where it is going. I see his back now and again. I must track him by the crackling of the branches.</p></div> </div>
