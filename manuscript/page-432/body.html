<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">morning, at this round table, the story of my singular adventures.</p><p>Are they over yet?</p><p>The Klotz-automobile is there in the coach-house, in a box which I have specially constructed for it.</p><p>In spite of my orders, the Nanthel mechanic put in some petrol, and my new chauffeur and I had the greatest trouble in bringing the human car here, for it was impossible to turn the waste-cocks for emptying the tank.</p><p>It began by destroying its successorâ€”a 20 h. p.  machine of the latest model. What could I do with this accursed Klotz-car? Sell it? Expose my fellow creatures to its malignity? That would have been a crime. Destroy it and so kill the Professor in his final transformation? That would be murder. So I locked it up.</p><p>The box has high oak partitions, and the door is heavily bolted.</p></div> </div>
