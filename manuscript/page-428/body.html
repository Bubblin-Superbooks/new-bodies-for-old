I could not give up that kind of life, except for the sort of money which Lerne promised me. I should have made you unhappy, and should have been unfaithful to you. All the rest amounts to nothing. I want a real man. It is not your fault, and so I hope this will not cause you any pain. Adieu for life.

Moreover, were not those sentiments which Emma was  expressing, exactly those which had charmed me in her? Had I not loved in her just that thirst for pleasure which was the cause of her bewitching beauty, and the cause of her infidelity?</p><p>I had the energy and wisdom to defer the rest of my reflections until the morrow. They might have brought on weakness in action.</p></div> </div>
