Far from desiring to arouse the creature of instinct in my reader and amuse him with scandalous descriptions, my work is addressed to the philosopher anxious for Truth amid the marvels of Fiction and for Orderliness amid the tumult of imaginary Adventures.</p><p>That, Sir, is why I beg you to accept it.</p></ul>",

  "page-14": "<h4>Introduction</h4><p class=\"  start-chapter\">It all happened on a certain winter evening more than a year ago, after the last men’s dinner-party I gave to my friends in the little house which I had taken furnished in the Avenue Victor Hugo.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">As my projected move was nothing more than the gratification of my vagrant fancy, we had celebrated my house-<em>un_warming as joyfully as we had celebrated the _warming</em> of yore, and the time for liqueurs having come (and also the time for jokes each of us did his best to shine—more especially of course, that naughty fellow Gilbert, Marlotte, our paradoxical friend, the</p>",
  "page-15": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">“Triboulet” of our band, and Cardaillac, our licensed wizard. )</p><p>I cannot remember now exactly how it came about, but after an hour spent in the smoking-room, somebody switched off the electric light, and urged us to have some table-turning; so we grouped ourselves in the darkness round a little table. This “somebody” (please observe was  not Cardaillac; but perhaps he was in league with Cardaillac—if indeed Cardaillac <em>was</em> the guilty party. )</p><p>We were exactly eight men in all, eight skeptics <em>versus</em> a little insignificant table which had only one stem divided off at the end into three legs, and whose round top bent under our sixteen hands placed on it in accordance with occult rites!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was Mariotte who instructed us in these rites. He had at one time been an anxious inquirer about witchcraft, and familiar with table-turning, though</p>",
  "page-16": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">merely as an outsider, and as he was our customary buffoon, when we saw him assume the direction of the <em>s�ance</em>, every one just let himself go in anticipation of some excellent clowning.</p><p>Cardaillac found himself my right-hand neighbor. I heard him stifle a laugh in his throat and cough. Then the table began to turn.</p><p>Gilbert questioned it, and to his obvious stupefaction it replied by dry cracklings like those made by creaking woodwork, and corresponding to the esoteric alphabet.</p><p>Mariotte translated in a quavering voice.</p><p>Then everybody wanted to question the table; and in its replies it gave proof of great sagacity. The audience became serious; one did not know what to think. Queries leapt to our lips, and the replies were rapped out from the foot of the table, near me—as I fancied—and towards my right.</p>",
  "page-17": "<p>“Who will live in this house in a year’s time?” asked in his turn he who had proposed the spiritualistic amusement.</p><p>“Oh, if you question it about the future,” said Mariotte, “you will only get back thumping lies, or else it will hold its tongue.”</p><p>“Oh, shut up,” interposed Cardaillac. The question was repeated—“Who will live in this house in a year’s time?”</p><p>“Nobody,” said the interpreter.</p><p>“And in two years’ time?”</p><p>“Nicolas Vermont.”</p><p>All of us heard this name for the first time.</p><p>“What will he be doing at this very hour on the anniversary of to-day? Tell us what he is doing—speak.”</p><p>“He is beginning ... to write here ... his adventures.”</p><p>“Can you read what he writes?”</p><p>“Yes ... and also what he <em>will</em> write.”</p>",
  "page-18": "<p>“Tell us the beginning, just the beginning.”</p><p>“Am tired—alphabet too tedious—Give typewriter ... will inspire typist.”</p><p>A murmur went round in the darkness. I rose and went to fetch my typewriter, and it was placed upon the table.</p><p>“It’s a ‘Watson,’” said the table. “I won’t have it. Am a French table. Want a French machine ... want a ‘Durand.’”</p><p>“‘A Durand?’” said my neighbor on the left, in a disillusioned tone. “Does that brand exist? I don’t know it.”</p><p>“Nor I.”</p><p>“Nor I.”</p><p>“Nor I.”</p><p>We were much vexed at this untoward circumstance, when the voice of Cardaillac said slowly:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I use nothing but a ‘Durand,’ would you like me to</p>",
  "page-19": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">fetch it?”</p><p>“Can you type without seeing?”</p><p>“I shall be back in a quarter of an hour,” said he—and he went out without answering.</p><p>“Oh, if Cardaillac is going to take it up,” said one of the guests, “we shall have a merry time.”</p><p>However, when the lights were turned up, the faces seemed sterner than one would have expected. Mariotte was quite pale.</p><p>Cardaillac came back in a very short time—an astonishingly short time, one might have said. He sat down in front of the table facing his “Durand” machine, and darkness was once more established. Suddenly the table declared: “No need of others.... Put your feet on mine ... type.”</p><p>One heard the tapping of the fingers on the keys.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“It’s extraordinary!” exclaimed the typist-medium,  “It’s extraordinary! My hands are writing of their own</p>",
  "page-20": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">accord.”</p><p>“What bosh!” whispered Mariotte.</p><p>“I swear they are, I swear it,” said Cardaillac.</p><p>We remained a long time listening to the tapping of the keys which was every now and then broken by the ringing of the bell at the end of the line and the rasping of the carriage. Every five minutes a sheet was handed to us. We decided to retire to the drawing-room and to read them aloud as Gilbert, getting them from Cardaillac, handed them to us.</p><p>Page 79 was deciphered in the morning light and the machine stopped.</p><p>But what it had typed seemed to us exciting enough to make us beg Cardaillac to be good enough to give us the sequel.</p><p>He did so. And when he had passed many nights seated at the little table with his typing keyboard, we had the complete story of M. Vermont’s adventures.</p>",
  "page-21": "<p>The reader shall now be told them.</p><p>They are strange and scandalous; their future scribe is <em>bound</em> not to think of printing them. <em>He will burn them</em> as soon as they are finished; so that, had it not been for the complaisance of the little table, no one would ever have turned the leaves. That is why I, convinced of their authenticity,  consider it <em>piquant</em> to publish them beforehand.</p><p>For I hold them to be “veridical,”—as the elect call it—although they have some of the characteristics of wild caricature, and rather resemble an art-student’s funny sketch penciled by way of commentary on the margin of an engraving representing Science herself.</p><p>Are they possibly apocryphal? Well, fables are reputed to be more seductive than History, and Cardaillac’s will not seem inferior to many another one.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">My hope, however, is that “Dr. Lerne” is the truthful account of real happenings, for in that case,</p>",
  "page-22": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">since the little table uttered a prophecy, the tribulations of the hero have not yet begun, and they will be running their course at the very time that this book is divulging them—a very interesting circumstance indeed.</p><p>At any rate I shall certainly know in two years’ time if M.

My late aunt, Lidivine Lerne, who was fond of legends, would have it that Satan, furious at some disappointment, had scooped it out with a single blow of his gigantic hoof. This origin is disputed. In any case the metaphor gives a vivid picture of the place, an amphitheater with precipitous walls of rock, with no other outlet than a large defile opening on the fields.

This latter is separated from the domain by a wall into which a gateway has been let. A long avenue leads up to it, straight, and lined with lime trees.

Well, well, that was merely a piece of stupidity on my part.</p><p>And I gazed in bad humor at the star of light on the roads where the exhausted head-lamps were casting no brighter an illumination than a night-light.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Without doubt I was going to pass the night in that</p>",
  "page-41": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sylvan jail; nothing would get me out of it before day. The toads of the pool in the Fonval direction called me in vain; vainly the steeple clock of Grey rang out the hours to tell me of the other resting-place—for belfries are really sonorous lighthouses—I was a prisoner.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">A prisoner! It made me smile. Long ago  how frightened I should have been! A prisoner in the Ardennes! At the mercy of Broc�liande, the monstrous forest which with its cavernous shade held a world in darkness between its boundaries, one being at Blois and the other in Constantinople! Broc�liande! that scene of epic tales and puerile legends, country of the four sons of Aymon and of Hop-o’-my-Thumb, the forest of druids and goblins, the wood in which Sleeping Beauty fell into slumber while Charlemagne kept watch! What fantastic stories had not its thickets for a stage—were not the trees themselves living persons? “Oh, Aunt Lidivine,” I murmured, “how well you could give life to</p>",
  "page-42": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">all those nonsensical tales every evening after dinner! The dear lady! Did she ever suspect the influence of her stories? Aunt, did you know that all your astounding puppets invaded my life by passing through my dreams? Do you know that a flourish of enchanted trumpets still sounds in my ears sometimes; you who made my nights at Fonval resound with the oliphant of Roland and the horn of Oberon?”</p><p>At that moment I could not check a movement of vexation; the head-lamps had just gone out after an agonized throb. For a second the darkness was total, and at the same time there was such a profound silence that I could well believe I had suddenly become blind and deaf.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Then my eyes gradually became unsealed, and soon the crescent moon appeared, shedding its snowy light on the cold night. The forest became lit up with a frozen whiteness. I shivered. In my aunt’s lifetime it</p>",
  "page-43": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">would have been with terror; I should have beheld in the darkness, where the vapors were creeping, dragons wallowing and serpents gliding. An owl flew off. I should have considered that bird the winged helm of a paladin—an enchanted paladin. The birch tree, standing straight up, shone with a lance-like gleam. An oak tree—a son perhaps of the magic tree which was the husband of the Princess Le�lina—quivered. It was huge and druidical—a bunch of mistletoe hung on its main branch, and the moon cut through it with a shining sacred sickle.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Assuredly the nocturnal landscape was like an hallucination. For want of something better to do, I meditated on it. Without understanding why as well as I do to-day, I used to experience all its suggestiveness, and at nightfall I only ventured out unwillingly. Fonval itself was, I think, in spite of its countless flowers and its beautiful winding alleys, a most forbidding place. Its</p>",
  "page-44": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">pointed windows, its hundred years old park inhabited by statues, the stagnant water of its pond, the precipice which closed it in, the Hell-like entrance, all these things made that ancient abbey (transformed into a <em>ch�teau</em> peculiar even in  daylight, and one would not have been surprised to learn that everybody there talked in fables. That would have been his real language. )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">That at any rate was how I talked, and still more how I acted, during my holidays. These were for me a long fairy tale in which I played with imaginary or artificial personages, living in the water, in the trees, and under the earth oftener than upon it. If I passed the lawn galloping with my bare legs, my air clearly showed the squadrons of knights were, in my fancy, charging behind me. And the old boat I masted for the occasion with three broomsticks, on which bellied nondescript sails, served me as a galleon, and the pond became the Mediterranean bearing the fleet of the Crusaders. Lost</p>",
  "page-45": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">in thought and looking at the water-lily islands and the grass peninsulas, I proclaimed: “Here are Corsica and Sardinia!... Italy is in sight.... We are sailing round Malta....” At the end of a minute I cried “Land!” We were landing in Palestine—“Montjoye and St. Denis!”—I suffered on that boat sea-sickness and home-sickness; the Holy War intoxicated me;—I learnt in it two things—enthusiasm and geography....</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But often the other characters were represented. That made it more real. I remembered then—for every child has a Don Quixote in him—I remembered a giant Briareus who was the  summerhouse, and especially a barrel which became the dragon of Andromeda. Oh, that barrel! I had made a head for it with the help of a squinting pumpkin, and vampire wings with two umbrellas. Having ambushed my contraption at the bend of an alley, leaning it up against a terra-cotta nymph, I set out in <em>search</em> of it more valiant than the</p>",
  "page-46": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">real Perseus, and, armed with a pole, I went caracoling on an invisible hippogriff. But when I <em>discovered</em> it, the pumpkin leered at me so strangely that Perseus almost took flight, and the umbrellas owed it to his emotion that they were broken to pieces in the yellow blood of the facetious vegetable.</p><p>My puppets did indeed make an impression on me by reason of the r�le I assigned them. As I always reserved for myself that of protagonist, hero, conqueror, I easily surmounted that terror during the day, but at night, though the hero became little Nicolas Vermont, an urchin, the barrel remained a dragon. Cowering under the sheets, my mind excited by the story which my aunt had just finished, I <em>knew</em> the garden was peopled with my terrifying fancies, and that Briareus was mounting guard there all the time, and that the dreadful barrel, resuscitated, hiding its claws with its wings, watched my window from afar.</p>",
  "page-47": "<p>At that age I despaired of ever being, later on in life, like other people, and able to face the dark.

There were three of them, and they were bending down as if they were following a trail.

But they perceived me and I advanced towards them.</p><p>“Gentlemen,” said I smiling my best, “could you kindly show me the way to Fonval?

My adventure became hourly more ridiculous. What was the meaning of all this? What comedy was I playing? Was I being made a fool of? I was furious.

Something at that time had profoundly influenced his mind.</p><p>“And what about his companions?” I went on, “the Germans?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Oh, as for them, Sir, they are invisible. Moreover, although I go to Fonval six times a week I do not remember when I last clapped eyes on the park. It’s Mr. Lerne himself who comes to the gate for his letters. Oh,</p>",
  "page-57": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">what a change! Did you know old John? Well, he’s gone, and his wife too. It’s as true as I’m talking to you, Sir. No more coachman, no more housekeeper ... no more horses.”</p><p>“That’s been so for four years, you say?”</p><p>“Yes, Sir.”</p><p>“Tell me, postman, there’s game about here, is there not?”</p><p>“Faith, no. A few rabbits, two or three hares—but there are too many foxes.”</p><p>“What, no roe-deer? no stags?”</p><p>“Never.”</p><p>And now I felt a strange thrill of joy.</p><p>“Here we are, Sir!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">After a final bend, the road did open out on the old avenue of which Lerne had kept this little bit.

  "page-58": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">coming towards us.</p><p>In front of it, a carriage-sweep in the shape of a half moon widened the avenue, and beyond that one saw the outline of the blue roof of the <em>ch�teau</em> against the green of the trees, and the trees themselves standing out on the somber flanks of the gully.</p><p>In the midst of the wall which joined the cliffs on either hand stood the door with its tiled porch. It had aged, and the stone of the lintel was worn away; the wood of its panels was worm-eaten and crumbling into powder here and there; but the bell had not changed. Its sound came from my distant boyhood, so bright and clear that I could have wept at it.</p><p>We waited for a few moments.</p><p>At last some wooden shoes clattered.</p><p>“Is that you, Guilloteau?” said a voice with a trans-Rhenish accent.</p><p>“Yes, Mr. Lerne.”</p>",
  "page-59": "<p>Mr. Lerne! I looked at my guide with eyes wide with wonder—What! Was that my uncle speaking like that?</p><p>“You are early,” went on the voice. There was the metallic sound of moving bolts; then the door was opened ajar, and a hand was passed through it.</p><p>“Give me them.”</p><p>“Here they are, Mr. Lerne. But there is  some one with me,” said the postman in an insinuating and timid way.</p><p>“Who is it?” cried the other—and in the fissure formed by the hardly opened door, he appeared.</p><p>It was my uncle Lerne. But life had laid hand on him, had made him much older, and turned him into this wild unkempt individual whose straggling gray hair covered his shabby clothes with dirty grease. He seemed smitten with premature old age, and there was an unfriendly gleam in the evil eyes which he fixed on me, from under their knitted eyebrows.</p>",
  "page-60": "<p>“What do you want?” he asked me rudely.</p><p>He pronounced the words like a German.</p><p>I had a moment of hesitation. The fact was that his face could no longer be compared to that of a kind old woman; it was a Sioux visage, hairless and cruel, and at the sight of it I experienced the contradictory sensations of recognizing it and not recognizing it.</p><p>“But, Uncle,” I stuttered finally, “it’s I.... I have come to see you—according to leave given by you. I wrote to you; but my letter ... here it is! my letter and I arrive together. Excuse my carelessness.”</p><p>“Ah, you should have told me. It is I that ask pardon of you, my dear nephew.”</p><p>A sudden change this! Lerne showed eagerness  to welcome me! he blushed and seemed confused and almost servile.

I could have wagered, looking at his perplexed expression, that he had no desire to do so, and that his thoughts were far away from joking.</p><p>The postman had taken his leave.</p><p>“Is the coach-house still there?” I said, pointing to the right at a brick building.</p><p>“Yes, yes. I did not recognize you because of your mustache—hum! Yes, your mustache. You hadn’t one long ago ... had you? Well, and how old are you?”</p><p>“Thirty-one, uncle.”</p><p>At the sight of the coach-house my heart stopped.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The dog-cart was moldering there, half buried under logs, and there, as in the neighboring stable which was</p>",
  "page-62": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">full of odds and ends, the spider webs were hanging whole or in shreds.</p><p>“Thirty-one, already,” went on Lerne in a vague and obviously distracted manner.</p><p>“But, Uncle, say <em>tu</em> and <em>toi</em> to me, as long ago.”</p><p>“Ah, yes, dear ... Nicolas, eh?”</p><p>I was very ill at ease, but he did not seem more at his ease than I was. My presence clearly annoyed him.</p><p>It is always an interesting thing for an intruder to learn why he is so,—I seized my valise. Lerne observed my gesture and seemed to form a sudden resolve.</p><p>“Let it be—let it be, Nicholas,” he said in a tone of command. “I’ll send to fetch your luggage shortly. But first we must have a talk. Come for a walk.”</p><p>He took my arm and drew me towards the park. He was still reflecting, however.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">We passed near the <em>ch�teau</em>. With few exceptions the shutters were closed. The roof in many places was</p>",
  "page-63": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sinking in, sometimes even broken, and the moldy walls from which the whitewash had disappeared in large flakes here and there showed their masonry. The plants in boxes still surrounded the house, but, to tell the truth, for several winters no one had thought of putting the verbenas and orange-trees and laurels under cover. Standing in their battered and rotten tubs they were all dead. The sandy carriage-drive, of yore so carefully raked, might have imagined itself a second-rate meadow, there was so much grass growing there mingled with  nettles and hemlock. It was like the castle of “Sleeping Beauty” on the Prince’s arrival. Lerne, clinging to my arm, walked without further talk.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">We got to the other side of the dreary pile, and the park lay before our eyes. A jumble. No more baskets of flowers, no more wide, sandy paths like winding ribbons. Except just in front of the <em>ch�teau</em>, the lawn—which had been metamorphosed into a paddock fenced</p>",
  "page-64": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">with wire and given up to some cattle to feed in—had been encroached on by the valley which had relapsed into its wild state. The garden was no more than a great wood with open spaces and green paths in it. The Ardennes had reassumed their usurped domain.</p><p>Lerne thoughtfully filled an immense pipe with feverish fingers, lit it, and then we went under the trees into one of the alleys that were like long caves.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Once more I saw the statues and with a disillusioned eye, the statues which a former master of Fonval had erected in profusion. Those magnificent dumb personages of my dramas were as a matter of fact wretched modern figures, suggested to some commercially-minded magnate of industry of the Second Empire by Rome or Greece. The tunics of concrete swelled out into crinolines, the drapery of the cloaks was like that of a shawl, and the divinities of the woods—Echo,  Syrinx, Arethusa—wore low chignons</p>",
  "page-65": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">which filled their bag-like nets—in the Benoiton manner. Those hideous representations of exquisite fantasies, of forest charms transmuted into Dryads, were to-day more passable in their mantles of virgin-vine and clematis, although certain heroes were no more than ivy-clad figures of fun, and although a mere moss-clad attitude represented Diana.</p><p>After walking for some time, my uncle made me sit down on a bench of stone covered with a coat of lichen, under the shade of flourishing hazels.</p><p>A little crackling sound made itself heard in the bower right over our heads.</p><p>Lerne jumped convulsively and raised his head.</p><p>It was merely a squirrel watching us from the top of a branch.</p><p>My uncle darted a ferocious glance at it, fixing it as if he were taking aim at it; then he began to laugh in a reassured sort of way.</p>",
  "page-66": "<p>“Ha, ha, ha! it’s only a little ... thing,” said he, unable to find the word.</p><p>“Really,” thought I within myself, “how queer one may become as one gets old. Environment, I know, is the cause of many evolutions; one adopts the ways and manner of speech of one’s familiars in spite of oneself; the surroundings of Lerne might suffice to explain why my uncle is  dirty, expresses himself ill, speaks with a German accent and smokes that huge pipe.... But he has ceased caring for flowers, he no longer looks after his property, and at this moment looks extraordinarily nervous and preoccupied. If one adds to that the happenings of last night, it all seems something less than natural.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Meanwhile the Professor looked at me in a disconcerting way, and eyed me up and down as if here were sizing me up and had never seen me before. I began to lose countenance. A fierce debate was going</p>",
  "page-67": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">on within him which was reflected on his face. Every moment our looks crossed, but at last they met, and joined, and my uncle, not being able to hold his peace any longer appeared for the second time to make up his mind.</p><p>“Nicolas,” he said, patting me on the thigh, “I am a ruined man, you know.”</p><p>I understood his plan, and was revolted.</p><p>“Uncle, be frank with me; you want me to go!”</p><p>“<em>I</em> want you to go! What an idea!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I am quite sure of it. Your invitation was rather discouraging, and your welcome hardly hospitable. But, uncle, you must have a very short memory if you think me avaricious enough to have come here merely for your money.

  "page-68": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">during these fifteen years <em>I</em> have not changed. I have never ceased venerating you with my whole heart, and have deserved better at your hands than those icy epistles and, above all, better than this insult.”</p><p>“There, there! Gently!” said Lerne, much annoyed.</p><p>“Moreover, if you want me to go, just say the word and I’m off. You are no uncle of mine now.”</p><p>“Don’t talk such blasphemous nonsense, Nicolas.” He said that in a tone of such alarm that I tried intimidation.</p><p>“And I shall inform against you, uncle, you and your acolytes and your mysteries.”</p><p>“You are mad, you are mad. Hold your tongue. <em>There’s</em> an idea for you!”</p><p>Lerne began to laugh loudly, but I don’t know why, his eyes frightened me, and I regretted my phrase.</p><p>He went on.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Look here, Nicolas, don’t get excited! You are a</p>",
  "page-69": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">good fellow. Give me your hand. You shall always find in me your old uncle who loves you. Listen, it’s not true; no, I am not ruined, and my heir will certainly get something—if he acts as I desire. But, as a matter of fact, I think he would do better not to stay here.... There’s  nothing here to amuse a man of your age, Nicolas; personally I am busy all day long.”</p><p>The Professor might talk as he liked now. Hypocrisy showed itself in every word; he was nothing but a contemptible Tartuffe; he was fair game. I determined not to leave till I had completely satisfied my curiosity. So, interrupting him, I said in a tone of deep dejection:</p><p>“There you are making use of the inheritance business again to make me decide to leave Fonval. You have clearly no trust in me.”</p><p>With a gesture he deprecated the idea. I went on:</p><p>“No, allow me to remain in order that we may renew our acquaintance. We both need to do so.”</p>",
  "page-70": "<p>Lerne knitted his eyebrows, then he said in a mocking tone:</p><p>“You insist on renouncing me?”</p><p>“No; keep me beside you, otherwise you will hurt my feelings deeply; frankly,” this in a bantering tone, “I should not know what to think.”</p><p>“Stop,” rejoined my uncle with energy, “there is nothing wrong to suspect here—far from it.”</p><p>“No doubt. All the same, you have secrets—as you have every right to have. If I speak to you of them, it is because I must resign myself to assure you that I shall respect them.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“There is only <em>one</em>! A single secret. And its  aim is noble and salutary,” said my uncle sententiously and with animation: “One only, I tell you—that concerning our work; a blessing to humanity—glory too and gold! But we must have silence assured us. Secrets! Everybody knows we are here, that we are working. The</p>",
  "page-71": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">newspapers have said so—there is no secret in that.”</p><p>“Keep calm, uncle, and tell me how I am to behave in your house. I am entirely at your disposal.”</p><p>Lerne resumed his inward debate:</p><p>“Well,” said he, raising his brow, “it is agreed. Such an uncle as I have always shown myself towards you cannot possibly drive you away. That would be belying all my past. Remain then, but on the following conditions:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“We are pursuing researches here that are about to come to their fulfillment. When our discovery is a <em>fait accompli</em> the public will hear of it in its entirety. Till then, I do not wish it to be informed of uncertain attempts whose revelation might raise up rivals capable of anticipating us. I do not doubt your discretion, but I prefer not to put it to the test, and I entreat you in your own interests not to try to surprise any secrets, rather than to be obliged to hide them. I say, ‘in your own</p>",
  "page-72": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">interests’; not merely because it is easier not to pry than to hold one’s tongue, but  also for the following reasons: Our business is a commercial one at bottom. A man of business like you will be very useful to me. We shall become rich, nephew—millionaires! But you must let me forget the instrument of your fortune in peace, you must show yourself a man of tact and respectful of my orders—in a word, the man I want as an associate. You must know, I am not alone in this enterprise. <em>They</em> might make you repent of your acts, if you transgressed the rule I am laying down for you—cruelly repent—more cruelly than you imagine. So practice indifference, my dear nephew. See nothing, hear nothing, understand nothing, in order that you may become very, very rich—and remain alive!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Oh, indifference is not so easy a virtue at Fonval. There have been things going about here since last night which should not be here and only find themselves here</p>",
  "page-73": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">through some bit of carelessness.”</p><p>At those words an unexpected rage seized Lerne. He flung out his fists and growled: “Wilhelm! Fool! Ass!” What I now felt sure of was that the secrets were considerable and would give me fine surprises were they discovered. As for the doctor’s promises, and his threats, I did not believe in either, and his speech had neither aroused covetousness nor fear in me—the  two passions that my uncle wished to make my counselors to obedience. I rejoined coldly:</p><p>“Is that all you ask of me?”</p><p>“No. But the next prohibition is of another kind, Nicolas. You will be presented to somebody in the <em>ch�teau</em>; it is a young girl I rescued....”</p><p>I made a movement of surprise, and Lerne guessed my imputation.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Oh!” he exclaimed, “she is like a daughter—nothing more. But her friendship is precious to me, and</p>",
  "page-74": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">it would be painful to me to see it lessened by a sentiment which I can no longer inspire. In short, Nicolas,” he said quickly and with a certain shamefacedness, “I ask you to swear not to pay court to my <em>prot�g�e</em>.”</p><p>Astounded at such a degraded view, and still more so at such a want of delicate feeling, I told myself, however, that there is no jealousy without love any more than there is smoke without fire.</p><p>“What do you take me for, uncle? It is sufficient that I am your guest.”</p><p>“All right—I know my physiology and how to use it. May I trust you? You swear it? Very well.”</p><p>“As for her,” he added with a crafty smile, “I am easy for the time being. She has lately seen my way of treating suitors. I advise you not to make trial of it.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Having got up, with his hands in his pockets, and his pipe between his teeth, Lerne looked me up and down</p>",
  "page-75": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">in a jocular and provocative manner. This physiologist inspired me with an unconquerable aversion.</p><p>We continued our walk round the park.</p><p>“Ah, by the way, do you know German?” said the Professor.</p><p>“No, uncle; I only understand French and Spanish.”</p><p>“No English either? That’s not much for a future merchant prince. You have not been taught much, I <em>fear</em>.”</p><p>“Tell that to the Marines, uncle,” said I to myself. “I had begun to keep wide open those eyes you commanded me to keep shut, and I saw just then that your satisfied expression gave your words the lie.”</p><p>We reached the end of the park by way of the foot of the cliffs and came in front of the <em>ch�teau</em> which seemed stretching its two wings towards us and dominating the underwood with its ruinous <em>fa�ade</em>.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And it was at this exact moment that my eye was</p>",
  "page-76": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">caught by an abnormal bird, a pigeon, which was wheeling in the air, and flew upwards with ever-narrowing and giddy circles.</p><p>“Just look at those roses on that long branch of briar; they are pretty and interesting,” said my  uncle. “Left to grow wild, they have become dog-roses again.”</p><p>“What a curious pigeon!” I said.</p><p>“Just look at those flowers,” insisted Lerne.</p><p>“One would think there was a drop of lead in its head. That happens sometimes when one is out shooting. It will tower and tower, and then fall from as high as possible.”</p><p>“If you don’t watch your feet, you will fall head over heels into the thorn-bushes. It’s a breakneck place, this, nephew.”</p><p>This useful bit of counsel was growled out in a menacing tone that sounded strangely out of place.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Then the bird attained the center of its spiral and</p>",
  "page-77": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">began not to mount, but to come down with wild tumblings, and whirling over and over. It hit a rock not far from us and fell, an inert thing, into the thick herbage.</p><p>Why did the Professor suddenly become more restless? Why did he hasten his steps? That is what I was asking myself, when the big pipe fell from his mouth. Having dashed forward to pick it up I could not restrain a look of stupefaction; he had snapped it off sharp with a furious bite.</p><p>The scene ended with a German word—doubtless an oath.</p><p>As we returned in the direction of the <em>ch�teau</em>  we saw running towards us a fat woman who seemed bursting out of her blue apron.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">She was evidently unused to such athletic exercise and it went against the grain, for it shook her dangerously, and as she trotted along, she kept herself</p>",
  "page-78": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">together by means of her arms and hands as if she were pressing some precious, huge and unwieldy burden against her person. At the sight of us, she stopped all of a piece—a thing that seemed almost an impossibility—then she seemed to want to retrace her steps. However, she came on with a guilty look on her kindly face, a look as of a school-girl caught in a fault. She awaited her fate.</p><p>Lerne scolded her:</p><p>“Barbe! What are you doing here? You have forgotten. I forbade you to go beyond the paddock. I’ll end by sending you packing, Barbe, after punishing you—you know.”</p><p>The fat woman was very much afraid. She tried to bridle, made a mouth as if she were going to lay an egg with it and excused herself—she had, from her kitchen, seen the pigeon fall and thought she might brighten up the bill of fare with it. “You always have the same dishes to eat.”</p>",
  "page-79": "<p>“And then,” she added stupidly, “I did not think you were in the garden, I thought you were in the lab....”</p><p>A brutal slap in the face interrupted her on  that syllable—the first syllable of “labyrinth,” as I imagined.</p><p>“Oh, uncle!” I cried indignantly.</p><p>“Look here, you! Hold your tongue, or off with you! That’s clear enough, isn’t it?”</p><p>Barbe was terrified and no longer wept. Her suppressed sobs made her hiccup. She was very pale, and on her cheek the bony hand of Lerne remained printed in red.</p><p>“Go and take this gentleman’s luggage from the coach-house and put it in the lion-room.”</p><p>(This room was on the first story of the western wing.)</p><p>“Won’t you give me my old room, uncle?”</p><p>“Which was that?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Which? Why, the one on the ground floor, the</p>",
  "page-80": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">yellow room, in the East wing, you know.”</p><p>“No. I use that one,” he said sharply. “Off with you, Barbe.”</p><p>The cook decamped as fast as she could.</p><p>On our right the pond was lying there stagnant. Our silent passage flung its shadow into it, and it looked there like a dream in a lethargy.</p><p>My astonishment was growing every moment. However, I kept myself from seeming too much surprised at the sight of a new and spacious building of gray stone built against the cliff. It consisted of two blocks separated by a courtyard. A high wall pierced with a carriage-gate, at the  moment shut, hid it from one’s eyes, but the clucking of fowls escaped from it, and a dog, having scented us, raised his voice.</p><p>I flung out a plummet at a venture:</p><p>“You’ll take me over your farm, won’t you?”</p><p>Lerne shrugged his shoulders:</p>",
  "page-81": "<p>“Perhaps,” he said. Then turning towards the house, he shouted:</p><p>“Wilhelm, Wilhelm!”</p><p>The German with the face like a sundial opened a little window and the Professor apostrophized him in his mother-tongue, so violently that the poor fellow trembled all over.</p><p>“By Jove!” I said to myself. “It’s owing to him and his inadvertence that _there are going about outside since last night, things that should not be there_—that’s certain.”</p><p>When the execution was over, we went round the paddock. It contained a black bull and four cows of various kinds, the whole lot of whom, for no particular reason, followed after us. My dreadful relative began to joke:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Nicolas, let me introduce you to Jupiter; and here is the white Europa, the dun-colored Io, the fair-skinned</p>",

To tell the truth, I should have seized the  first pretext to have a laugh; I had physical need of it. I also felt a hunger so intense that to satisfy it seemed the only question of any interest. The <em>ch�teau</em> was the one and only attraction. It was there I should <em>eat</em>! And the attraction it exercised on me almost made me fail to examine the hothouse, its neighbor.</p><p>That would have been a pity. They had added two halls of glass to it which flanked the original rotunda with their domed naves. Under its lowered outer blinds the building seemed to me to form a whole that was “perfect of its kind.” It suggested something between a Crystal Palace and a glass melon-bell; it had quite a grand and out-of-the-way appearance, if I may so say.</p>",
  "page-83": "<p>A hothouse of this kind in this thicket! I should have been less astonished to find a love-philter in a monastery!</p><p>In the days of my late lamented aunt, the lion-room was reserved for guests. It had—it still has—three windows, with deep recesses as deep as alcoves. One of them looks out in the direction of the conservatory and has a balcony attached; the second opens on the park; I saw the paddock from it and further away the pond, and between the two that summerhouse which once was Briareus. The third window faces the eastern wing; from there I saw the window of my old  room—shut—and the whole <em>fa�ade</em> of the <em>ch�teau</em> blocking the view on the left.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I felt as if I were in an hotel.

Two pictures balanced one another: <em>The Education of Achilles</em> and <em>The Rape of Deianeira</em>, in which the damp spotted the faces of the four subjects with red and dappled the cruppers of the Centaurs, Chiron and Nessus; there was also rather a fine Norman clock which looked like a coffin set on end, the emblem and at the same time the measures of Time—and the whole furnishing of the room was commonplace and out-of-date.</p><p>I splashed my face with cold water and put on clean linen with pleasure. Barbe brought me, without knocking at the door, a plate of coarse broth, and made no reply to my condolences on her inflamed cheek; then she waddled out of the room like a gigantic sylph.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">There was no one in the drawing-room—unless shades are people.

From the unspeakable white paper on the walls down which hung garlands of flowers trussed like sausages, to the hangings of sulphur-colored damask draping their fringed basques in a row, the work of the former owner—a contemporary of the crinoline—had admirably stood the effect of time.

A large-sized group claimed my attention. I took it up to look at it more carefully. It represented my uncle surrounded by five gentlemen and a big St. Bernard dog. The group had been taken at Fonval; the wall of the <em>ch�teau</em> made the background, and a rose-laurel in a tub figured in the picture. An  amateur’s work and unsigned.

In that case, I never saw a woman who was more a woman than Emma. I shall not describe her, having scarcely noted more in her than an abstraction and not an object. Was she beautiful? No doubt; most assuredly desirable.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Yet, I do remember her hair. It had the color of fire, a dull red—possibly dyed—and the image of her body</p>",

They were all there, and all fruits too, <em>but neither flower nor fruit had grown on its own tree</em>!</p><p>A colony of cornflowers garnished a stalk ceded by moss-roses, and which now waved about, a thyrsus thenceforward blue. An araucaria unfolded at the tip of its bristling branches the indigo-colored bells of the gentian, and along an espalier among nasturtium leaves and on the loops of its serpentine stalk, camelias and parti-colored tulips blossomed fraternally together.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Opposite the entrance-door, a clump of bushes rose</p>",

One of these fruits was an abortion: neither “chalk nor cheese” it was forming into a glaucous tumor streaked with pink—a thing monstrous and repellant.</p><p>Instead of cones, a fir tree was dotted with chestnuts like shining stars, and, moreover, it flaunted this strange contrast: the orange—that golden sun of Eastern orchards—and the medlar, which looks like a posthumous fruit of a tree that has died of cold!</p>",
  "page-102": "<p>Not far away there was a throng of still more fully developed miracles. Flora was elbowing Pomona, as the good Demoustier would have phrased it. Most of the plants that formed this crowd were strange to me, and I only remember the commoner ones, those that anybody knows the list of. I can still see an astounding willow which bore hortensias and peonies, peaches and strawberries. But the prettiest of all those hybrids was perhaps a rose tree with ox-eyes for flowers and crab-apples for fruit.</p><p>In the center of the rotunda a bush showed a mingling of leaves so dissimilar as those of the holly, the lime and the poplar. Having pressed them apart I satisfied myself that they issued all three from a single stem.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was the triumph of grafting—a science that Lerne had for fifteen years been pushing to the verge of the miraculous, so far indeed that the results presented a</p>",

Can one play this sacrilegious game without high treason against Nature? If only those artificial things had been in good taste! But, devoid of real novelty, they were merely curious mixtures, a sort of vegetable chimeras, floral Fauns, half this and half that. On my honor, graceful or not, this kind of work is impious, and that’s the long and the short of it.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Be that as it may, the Professor had toiled most laboriously to bring his work to so successful an issue.

Would one have believed it? I was assailed by a ridiculous anguish as I looked at the oak-tree (which had had an operation because I fancied the cherries looked like drops of blood...! Flop! flop! Two ripe ones fell at my feet like the first drops of a thunder-storm. )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I was no longer possessed of the calm necessary for reading the labels.

Its glass vault filtered the daylight and attenuated it to a bluish and refreshingly cool half-light. My steps rang out on the flagstones.</p><p>In this chamber there gleamed three aquariums, three tanks of glass, so pure that the water seemed  to be standing of itself in three geometrical blocks.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The aquariums on the two sides of the hall held marine plants which did not seem to differ much one from the other.

On the right, as on the left, arborescences of every color had fixed their rigid and bifurcated stems on the rocks; the sandy bottom was sprinkled with stars like edelweiss, and here and there sprung up sheaves of chalky rods, at the end of each of which a sort of fleshy chrysanthemum unfolded itself like a yellow or a violet flower. I cannot describe the host of other <em>coroll�</em>; they often resembled oily <em>calices</em> of wax or of gelatine; most of them showed an indefinable color in a vague outline, and sometimes they had no edges and were mere <em>nuances</em> in the midst of the water.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Bubbles escaped in thousands from an inside tap, and their tumultuous pearls raced madly along the foliage before they rose to burst on the surface.

I tapped the left-hand trough.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Immediately an unexpected thing moved before me swimming by means of contraction; it was like an opaline Venetian goblet which had remained malleable; a second crossed over the first; they were two jelly-fish. Meanwhile the tapping of my fingers had set other things moving.

  "page-108": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and saffrons swayed about, and, as if under the influence of an eddy the whole aquarium became alive.</p><p>I tapped on the right-hand trough. Nothing budged.</p><p>This was proof positive; this separation of the polypi into two receptacles gave me a clearer understanding of the connection which, joining the animal and the vegetable, makes man akin to the blade of grass. At this meeting-place of the two organized kingdoms, the creatures on the  left—active—were at the foot of their scale, and those on the right—inactive—at the top of theirs; the former were on the way to becoming beasts, the latter had finished being plants.</p><p>Thus, the gulf which seems to separate those two extreme poles in the world is reduced, as far as structure goes, to slight divergences, almost invisible—a less striking difference than that between the wolf and the fox which are, however, brothers.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Now, this infinitesimal difference in organization</p>",
  "page-109": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">which Science, however, regards as unsurmountable, since it separates <em>inertia</em> from spontaneous movement—this difference Lerne had bridged!

I noted there a gelatinous sort of leaf of the immobile order, grafted on to a mobile stem, and now moving about too. The grafts adopted the condition of the plant into which they were inserted; penetrated with a life-giving juice, their indifference changed to animation, and the activity of the other was paralyzed through sucking in the <em>ankylosis</em>.</p><p>I would willingly have passed in review the various applications of this principle; but a <em>medusa</em> tied with a hundred knots to some seaweed or other struggled violently in its mossy net, and I turned away in disgust.</p><p>This last stage in grafting in spite of difficulties completed the profanation in my eyes, and I looked away into the blue shadow for less disagreeable sights.</p>",

These were some very humble plants in their china pots. Their names in <em>um</em> or <em>us</em> have gone from my memory, a thing I deplore, for they would give my tale more authoritativeness, and more resonance. But who, at the  mention of their ordinary names, could fail to represent to himself a tuft of plantain and a tuft of hare’s-ear?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The former was, it is true, of an exceptionally long and supple sort.

This is only a repetition of what I have already seen, or rather an early, timid and simple essay, a stage on the road to the rotunda, as <em>it</em> is a stage on the way to the atrocities of the aquarium. I might have begun here, gone on to the central garden of Eden, and finished off by the polypi. Thank God, I have seen the worst.”</p><p>So ran my thoughts, when <em>the twig of the plantain twisted about like a worm</em>!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At the same time a mass of shining gray gave a jump which betrayed its presence behind the dresser.

My reflections were as follows:—</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“To sum up, Lerne has tried to amalgamate vegetables and animals, and to make them exchange their vitalities.

The park of Fonval is my earthly paradise.”</p><p>“There you are right. It’s just that,” he said laughingly, “the forbidden tree grows in its inclosure. Every hour you will come up against the Tree of Life, and the Tree of Knowledge which you must not touch. It’s dangerous. In your position I should go out for a run in your mechanical carriage.

There was no denying that my uncle had made up his mind to endure my intrusion with courage. Nevertheless his persistent good temper  only vexed me. My projects of indiscretion seemed less legitimate to me. Perhaps I should have abandoned them altogether at that moment, had not my desire for Emma driven me to wish ill to her despotic jailor. Besides, was he sincere? And was it not merely to incite me to keep my plighted word that he said to me on arriving at the improvised garage:</p>",
  "page-127": "<p>“Nicolas, I have reflected a great deal. I really do think you might be very useful to us in the future, and I desire your further acquaintance.

But don’t forget your promises.”</p><p>I nodded assent. “After all,” thought I, “it really seems as if he wanted one day to publish the solution to the problem. Why should it not be legitimate enough, though the operations that are to procure it are not so? It’s them he wishes to hide until the result comes; he expects the <em>�clat</em> of the latter to excuse the barbarity of the former and to obtain his pardon—if only the end does not betray the means, and the means can remain forever unknown. On the other hand, might Lerne not be afraid of competition? Why not?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I was ruminating on all this as I emptied a little tin</p>",

He pointed out to me a straight road that skirted a cliff of the defile, a surreptitious cross-road ingeniously concealed. I was astonished at first that my uncle should have pointed out this short cut to me, but, after all, was he not showing me how to get away, and was not this <em>au fond</em> what he most desired?</p><p>Oh, the dear uncle! He must have lived a very secluded or very absorbed life, for he was pathetically ignorant of all that concerns motor-cars. His was the sort of ignorance <em>savants</em> have with regard to sciences in which they are not specialists. My physiologist was not strong on the subject of mechanics. He hardly suspected the principle of this docile, supple, silent and speedy engine of locomotion which roused his enthusiasm.</p>",

Two screws and a piece of wire restored its deafening power. Lerne, at the sound of it, beamed with ingenuous  delight. I went on with my lecture, and as I talked, my uncle listened to me with increasing attention.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In truth the thing deserved attentive interest. During the preceding three years, if motor engines had but little changed in the essentials of their structure and in that of their principal organs, fittings on the other hand had progressed, and the materials employed were employed more judiciously. Thus, in the construction of my car,</p>",
  "page-130": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">whose only woodwork was the racing-seats, no wood had been employed. My 80 horse-power affair formed a little luxurious and neatly furnished workshop all of cast iron and steel, of copper and aluminum.

Nowadays that seems quite a matter of course; but a year ago my iron fellies caused much surprise.</p><p>But the most remarkable thing about my 234 XY, when you come to think of it, was, I think, that improvement which engineers obtained so slowly that one did not see it growing day by day—I mean its automatism.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The first horseless machine was encumbered with levers, pedals, handles and wheels necessary for its guidance, and with taps and grease-valves to turn, which were indispensable for the functioning  of the</p>",
  "page-131": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">engine. Now, each generation of motor-cars has dispensed with these more and more completely. One by one, almost all those handles have disappeared which require the incessant intervention of man. In our days, by means of its organs which have become automatic, the mechanism controls the mechanism. A chauffeur is no more than a pilot; once going, his machine keeps up its own energy; once awake, it will only fall asleep again at the word of command. In short, as Lerne bade me note, the modern motor-car enjoys properties that a spinal cord might confer; it enjoys instinct and reflex actions. Spontaneous movements take place in it along with the voluntary movements caused by the intelligence of the driver, who becomes as it were the brain of the vehicle. It is from this intelligence that the orders for definite actions go, transmitted by the metallic nerves to the steel muscles.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Moreover,” said my uncle, “the resemblance</p>",
  "page-132": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">between this machine and the body of a vertebrate animal is striking.”</p><p>Here Lerne was entering his own domain. I lent an attentive ear, and he went on:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“We have here the nervous and muscular systems represented by the striker-rods, the driving-gear and the cranks. And the <em>ch�ssis</em>, Nicolas, what is it but the skeleton into which the tenants insert themselves like tendons? Blood, the vital  element, circulates in those copper arteries in the form of petrol. The carburetor breathes; it’s a lung; instead of combining air with blood, it mixes it with the vapor of the petrol, that’s all! This hood resembles a <em>thorax</em> in which life beats rhythmically—our joints move in the <em>synovia</em> as those swivel-joints in oil. Under the shelter of the resisting skin of the case is the tank, a stomach that grows hungry and is replenished. Here, phosphorescent like those of cats, but <em>as yet</em> void of sight, are eyes, its lamps; its voice</p>",
  "page-133": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">is the hooter; and—but I need not go into further details. In a word, Nicolas, the only thing wanting to your car is brain, which you sometimes supply; having that it would become a great deaf beast, blind, insensitive and sterile, without the sense of taste or of smell.”</p><p>“A regular collection of infirmities,” I said, bursting into a loud laugh.</p><p>“Hum!” rejoined Lerne, “in other respects the motor-car is better off than we. Think how the water cools it; what a remedy against fever! And then what a time the engine can last, if it is wisely used! It can be mended indefinitely—it can always be cured; have you not just restored speech to its maw? You could replace an eye just as easily!”</p><p>The Professor was getting excited:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“It’s a powerful and terrible body,” he cried,  “but a body that allows itself to be clothed—it has armor</p>",
  "page-134": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">which increases the power of the wearer beyond all expectation, a cuirass that multiplies its force and speed. Why, you inside it are like the Maritans of Mr. Wells in their tripod cylinders! You are nothing but the brain of an artificial monster that it makes one giddy to think of.”</p><p>“All machines are like that, uncle.”</p><p>“No. Not so completely. But for the form (which no animal resembles of course the automobile is the most congruous automaton ever contrived. It is more made in our image than the best mannikin wound up by a key, the most human of puppets. For under their anthropomorphic envelope those mannikins hide a mere roasting-jack organism, which one would not compare with the anatomy of a snail. Whereas here....” )</p><p>He drew back a step and regarded my car with a look of tenderness:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“What a superb creature,” he exclaimed, “and how</p>",
  "page-135": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">great is man!”</p><p>“Yes,” said I to myself, “there is a deal more beauty in a thing we create, than in all your sinister joining of flesh and wood that are both from of old. But it’s not bad on your part to have admitted it.”</p><p>Though it was late, I went on to Grey-l’Abbaye to replenish my stock of petrol, and though he was  a creature of routine, Lerne, infatuated with automobilism, passed beyond the traditional limit of his walks and insisted on accompanying me.</p><p>Then we resumed the way to Fonval. My uncle, with all the ardor of a neophyte, bent over the bonnet in order to listen to the pulsations within the metal frame, then he took to pieces one of the oil-valves. All the time he kept questioning me, and I had to inform him of the smallest details of my car, details which he assimilated with an incredible accuracy.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I say, Nicolas, sound the hooter, will you?</p>",
  "page-136": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Now—go slow—stop—start again—quicker—that will do—put on the brake—back now—stop—it’s colossal!”</p><p>He was laughing. His cloudy face seemed almost beautified. Seeing us one would have said we were excellent friends. In fact we were so then perhaps. And I fancied that perhaps, thanks to my “two-seater,” Lerne might one day confide in me.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He preserved this gayety till our return to the <em>ch�teau</em>; the proximity of the mysterious workshop did not affect it; it only disappeared in the dining room. Then suddenly Lerne’s brow darkened. Emma had just come in. And the husband of my aunt Lidivine seemed to have effaced himself with my uncle’s smile, only an  irritable old <em>savant</em> remaining between his two guests. I then felt how little his future discoveries mattered in comparison with this woman, and that he wanted to acquire glory and wealth only in order to keep the</p>",

  "page-138": "<p>As I was interpreting this unwonted emotion on her part in my favor, Lerne, hostile and taciturn, broke up the party.

I could hear nothing. Only from the old-fashioned clock came any sound—that  of Time’s sickle. My head fell back on the pillow.</p><p>Then suddenly, with a shuddering of my whole being, I buried myself in the blankets with my fingers in my ears. The sinister howling was rising from the park into the night, a sinister, unearthly howling. It was indeed that which I had heard in my nightmare; my dream had mingled with reality.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">With a superhuman effort I arose, and it was then that I heard yelpings—a sort of stifled yelpings, very</p>",

It was a huge animal, and it had laid its front paws on the closed shutters of my former bedroom, and every now and then uttered a loud long wail. The other barkings—the stifled ones—replied to him from the inside of the house; but were they really yelps? Had my ears deceived me? It sounded more like the voice of a man trying to imitate the  voice of a dog. The more I listened, the more that conclusion</p>",
  "page-141": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">forced itself on me. Yes, certainly there could be no mistake; how could I have hesitated? It was quite clear—some practical joker in my bedroom was amusing himself with teasing the poor brute.</p><p>And he succeeded in doing so; for the animal gave signs of increasing exasperation. He modulated his howling in the most extraordinary manner, making it sound like a cry of despair. Finally he scratched the shutters with rage and bit them. I heard the crackling of the wood between his jaws.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Suddenly the beast became motionless, its hair bristling. There was a brusque and violent outburst in that room. I recognized my uncle’s voice but could not catch the meaning of his reprimand. Immediately the joker was silent. But—and how to account for this amazing circumstance?—the dog whose frenzy should have been appeased, was now beside itself; its backbone bristled up like that of a wild boar. Growling, it began</p>",

His first look was towards my window.</p><p>In a low voice, with restrained wrath, the Professor  lectured the dog, but he did not come forward, and I perceived he was afraid of it. The other came nearer, growling, with its eyes flashing from under its great brow. Lerne then spoke aloud:</p><p>“To your kennel, you dirty brute!” (Then came some words in a foreign tongue. “Get away,” he went on in French; and as the animal still came on—“Do you want me to knock your brains out? Eh?” )</p><p>My uncle seemed to be losing his wits. The moon heightened his pallor. “He’ll be torn to bits,” I said to myself, “he has not even a riding-switch.”</p>",

Had Lerne grown suspicious of me, and contrived to have all my time taken up?</p><p>In the morning, he would invite me to accompany him—one day on foot, and another in the motor-car. During those outings we would talk at random of scientific matters, and he would question me as if he really wished to judge of my capabilities.</p>",
  "page-171": "<p>With the motor-car we used to cover much ground. In our walks, my uncle usually took the road which led straight to Grey. He would often stop, the better to hold forth, and never went beyond the skirts of the wood. Often in the midst of a dissertation or a jest, after we had started walking or driving, Lerne would suddenly go back, distrusting the people he had left at Fonval.</p><p>He also organized my afternoons for me; sometimes I was charged with a message for the town or the village, sometimes forced to go off by myself on some errand. I had either to fill up my  tank without question, or put on my walking boots.</p><p>Lerne always watched me go, and at nightfall, standing on his doorstep, he exacted from me an account of my day. As the case might be, I had either to give a report of what I had done, or describe places.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Now, my uncle was not, as a rule, familiar with</p>",
  "page-172": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">places, it is true, but I could not tell which ones, and so any made-up story would have been dangerous. I therefore conscientiously explored the forest and the countryside from dawn to dusk.</p><p>And yet, I should have liked to go to Emma’s room. I had calculated its place in the topography of the castle by the number of windows which were, or were not shut, and I knew them all thoroughly.</p><p>The whole left wing always remained closed. In the right wing, the ground floor, and, of the six bedrooms above, only three remained open for daily use. Mine was in the projecting part of the building, and, at the other end, the room of my Aunt Lidivine opened on the central corridor, and communicated with Lerne’s, so that Emma must have succeeded my aunt in my aunt’s own bed. The very thought of it maddened me, and I waited impatiently for the opportunity I sought.</p><p>But the Professor was keeping watch!</p>",
  "page-173": "<p>Under his pitiless tyranny, I saw Mlle. Bourdichet  only at meal-times. We both put on a detached air. I now ventured to look at her, but I did not dare to speak to her. She persisted in a most absolute silence, so much so, that, in absence of conversation, I had to judge of her nature by her bearing, but I must admit that, however gross may be the human functions of feeding oneself on dead beasts and withered plants, there are two methods of eating. This lady thought nothing of taking the chicken bone, or cutlet bone in her fingers, and every time she gave herself up to this pleasure, I fancied I should hear her say, “My little duck,” in her plebeian voice.</p><p>Between Emma and me, Lerne fidgeted about. He crumbled the bread, and dallied with his fork, and suppressed anger would make him bring down his fist on the cloth till the cups and glasses rattled.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">One day, by mischance, my foot knocked against</p>",
  "page-174": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">him. The Doctor suspected this innocent foot of light behavior.

It  so happened that on that very day, my uncle said to me suddenly that he wanted to take me in the car to Nanthel, where he had business. I fancied I saw a chance of escape from his vigilance.</p><p>The next day was a Sunday, and Grey was celebrating the Feast of its Patron Saint. I should know how to profit by that!</p><p>“With pleasure, Uncle,” I said. “We shall start in the car, barring accidents.”</p>",

The village inn was already full of people, singing, and not yet fighting. The church-bells were ringing their chimes of warning, and in the center of the Square, a little white building, decorated with greenery, showed that the Municipal Band would soon be adding its very simple strains to the hubbub of the f�te.</p><p>When we got to the station (this was the moment I had chosen to act), I said:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Uncle, shall I accompany you in your rounds at</p>",
  "page-177": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Nanthel?”</p><p>“Certainly not. Why?”</p><p>“Well, Uncle, in my dislike for <em>caf�s</em>, taverns and public-houses, I shall ask you to leave me here, where I shall wait for you just as easily as in the shop in Nanthel.”</p><p>My uncle replied:</p><p>“But, you are not obliged....”</p><p>“To begin with, I find the Grey Festival attracts me. I should like to watch the crowds a little longer. On such a day one gets the liveliest impressions of the manners of a people, and I feel, to-day, that I have the soul of an ethnologist.”</p><p>My uncle said, “You are joking, or else it is a mere whim.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“In the second place, Uncle, whom could I trust with my car?

No, no, I prefer to watch my car myself.”</p><p>My uncle was not convinced of my sincerity. He wished to checkmate the little trick which I might be planning of going back to Fonval, either in my motor-car, or on a borrowed bicycle, with the intention of coming back to Grey in time for the 5.15—and that was just exactly the plan which I <em>had</em> thought of. The accursed <em>savant</em> nearly upset everything.</p><p>“You are right,” said he coldly, and he set his foot on the ground, and amid the crowd of holiday travelers in their Sunday best, raised the bonnet of the car, and looked at the engine minutely. I felt quite uncomfortable.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">My uncle took out his knife—took the carburetor,  and slipped some of the pieces into his pocket, and</p>",
  "page-179": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">addressed me thus:</p><p>“There is your car, brought to a standstill,” said he, “but as you might make off in another way, I am going to give you something to do. On my return, you must show me the carburetor, completely restored, and fitted up with pieces of your own make. The blacksmith has not yet shut up his forge—he will lend you an anvil and vise; but he is a fool, and quite unable to help you. There will be enough there to keep you amused until 5.14.”</p><p>Perceiving that I did not seem to mind, he went on in a constrained tone:</p><p>“I must ask your pardon. Please do not doubt that, all this is only to assure your future by protecting the secret of our work. Good-by.”</p><p>The train carried him off.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I had let him talk without showing any signs of annoyance; and indeed, without feeling any, for, being</p>",
  "page-180": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">but a poor chauffeur, detesting grease and scars on my hands, and obliged by my uncle’s will to do without a mechanic, I had brought with me, in the boot of my car, several spare pieces, amongst which, was a complete carburetor, ready to be put in its place.

He was so, a circumstance which filled my heart with a vast satisfaction.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Some white clouds were floating in a cold sky. The wind was coming from Grey-l’Abbaye, and brought me through the gorge the monotonous sound of the church bells.

In the middle of this wood, I used to possess an old friend—a fir tree. Its projecting branches formed a spiral staircase. It completely dominated the buildings. No laboratory could have been better placed, or more accessible, and in the old days I used to play there at being a sailor on the yard-arms.</p><p>The tree offered me a perch, rather short, no doubt, but still, well padded. On the upper branches, a relic awaited me, made of cords and rotten planks—the cross-trees! Who would have said that one day I, who used to spy out continents, archipelagoes—phantasies with some likelihood about them—should now be there as a spy for things so fabulously unreal? My glances turned towards the ground.</p>",
  "page-183": "<p>As I have said, the laboratory was composed of a courtyard between two blocks of buildings. The one on the left was pierced with large bay windows on its one story, and on its ground floor. It seemed to me to be merely two large rooms—one above the other. I only saw the higher one,  which was elaborately equipped—an apothecary’s cupboard, marble tables covered with bulbs, bottles and retorts, cases (open), sets of polished instruments, and two indescribable pieces of apparatus of glass and nickel, which recalled nothing analogous, except, perhaps, vaguely, the round globes screwed to a stand on which <em>caf�</em> waiters lay their napkins.</p><p>The other block which was beyond my range, looked from the outside like an ordinary dwelling-house, and was evidently the place where the two assistants lodged.</p><p>But, what I had taken for a farmyard on the day of my arrival, took up all my attention.</p>",
  "page-184": "<p>What a miserable farmyard!

A nest of mice, I presumed.</p><p>The last cage on the right served as a hen-house. Contrary to custom, they had locked up the poultry in it.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Everything looked mute and melancholy.

When Lerne touched my shoulder, I was endeavoring, with a great show of effort to screw up a nut which was already perfectly tight.</p><p>“Nicolas!”</p><p>I turned towards my uncle a face like a coal-heaver’s, putting on as harsh an expression as I could.</p><p>“I have just finished,” I muttered; “that was a nice trick of yours, getting people to work all for nothing.”</p><p>“Does it work all right again?”</p><p>“Oh, yes!

You understand how things are, don’t you?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Evidently Lerne was afraid he had vexed me, and that, as a result of my annoyance, I might disclose the</p>",

It seemed to me that in his place, had I been obliged to receive a third party because of his relationship with me, I should assuredly have preferred to make him my accomplice as soon as possible, so as to insure his discretion.</p><p>“After all,” thought I to myself, “why has my uncle not thought of it? Before the uncertain, and perhaps illusory date when Lerne is to initiate me, he will have to pass through a long period of torment while he exercises over me the double vigilance of an analyst and a police-officer.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Suppose I were to anticipate his project?

Yes, that’s it!</p><p>“But how to hit on a crime which Lerne might perpetrate, and which I might say is natural and harmless, and one which I would commit on the first occasion myself?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Good heavens, Nicolas!

I forgot that his work, carried on with such secrecy, and secure from risk of imitation, might well have an industrial aim.

Are we not the  slaves of the animals, and even the plants which unceasingly rebuild our bodies with their flesh and their pulp?”</p><p>My uncle was so pleased with his paradoxes, that he shouted them out, and fidgeted about in his seat, and sawed the air in a frenzy, as if he were seizing ideas in armfuls.</p><p>“My dear nephew, what a splendid idea it was of yours to bring this car! It does buck me up wonderfully. I must learn how to drive the beast. I shall be the mahout of this fierce mammoth. Eh! Eh! Ah!

Why aren’t you always like this, and why do you distrust me—me, who, on the contrary—deserve all your confidence?”</p><p>“But,” said Lerne, “you know quite well I will give it to you when the time has come. I have quite decided on that.”</p><p>“Why not at once, uncle?”</p><p>And I plunged bald-headed into my folly. “Are we not made of the same stuff, you and I? You don’t know me! Nothing can astonish me, and I  know more than you think! Yes, uncle, I share your opinions and admire your acts.”</p><p>Lerne, somewhat surprised, began to laugh.</p><p>“What do you know about it?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“What I know is that one cannot trust to the law.</p>",

My own safety requires that at the risk of hurting their feelings more, I must inform them. I shall write to them no later than to-night to come and fetch him. Poor Donovan! His departure will, I hope, disprove your suspicion, but you have disappointed me very much, Nicolas.”</p><p>I was greatly confused. Had I made a mistake, or had Emma lied to me?

  "page-239": "<p>Donovan allowed me to touch him. The Doctor examined him thoroughly, but obviously the scar attracted his greatest attention.

It was the wren which was forcing the serpent to recoil! It advanced in little quick jumps, without a quiver of its wings, and as if hypnotizing its enemy.

The Professor did not reply.</p><p>“Oh, what’s the matter?” said she. “What’s the matter, again, <em>mon Dieu</em>?”</p><p>“Is it so grave, uncle?” I asked in my turn.</p><p>“No,” replied Lerne. “Donovan is dead, that’s all.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Poor fellow,” said Emma. Then after a silence: “Is it not better to be dead than mad? After all it is the best</p>",
  "page-360": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">thing for him. Come,  Nicolas, you are not going to put on a face like that! Come!”</p><p>And she seized my hand, and dragged me to the <em>ch�teau</em>.</p><p>Lerne went away in the other direction.</p><p>I was prostrated. “Let me alone,” I said, “let me alone. Donovan, the poor wretch. Let me alone. You cannot know! Let me alone, I say.”</p><p>A maddening fear came over me. Leaving Emma I ran after my uncle and joined him at the laboratory. He was talking to Johann, and showing him the telegram. The German disappeared into the house at the very moment that I accosted the Professor.</p><p>“Uncle, you have not told him anything, have you? You have not said anything to Johann?”</p><p>“Yes, why?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Oh, but he will inform the others, and the others will repeat it before Nell! Nell will know it, uncle, that</p>",
  "page-361": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">is certain. They will tell her, and Donovan’s soul will learn that it no longer has a human body. It must not be! It must not be!”</p><p>“There is no danger, Nicolas, I assure you.”</p><p>“No danger! Those men are scoundrels, I tell you! Let me prevent this catastrophe! Time is passing, let me in, I entreat you! Please, for a second, I entreat you! Damn it all, I will pass!”</p><p>The lessons I had learned from the bull stood me in good stead; I charged head first.</p><p>My uncle fell back on the grass, and with a blow of my fist I opened the already half open door. At this, Johann, who was on the watch behind it, fell back, bleeding at the nose, and then I penetrated to the courtyard, and decided to take away the dog at any hazard, and never again be separated from it.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The pack slipped into their kennels. I saw Nell immediately. They had given her a kennel apart from</p>",
  "page-362": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the others. Her great starved, hairless, wretched body was lying against the grating.</p><p>I called out, “Donovan, Donovan!” She did not budge.</p><p>The eyes of the dogs gleamed in the depths of their somber huts, and some of them growled.</p><p>“Donovan! Nell!” I had an intuition of the truth. There also the scythe of Death had done its work. Yes, Nell also was cold and stiff. A chain twisted round her neck seemed to have strangled her. I was going to make sure of this, when Lerne and Johann showed themselves at the entrance of the courtyard.</p><p>“Villains,” I cried, “you have killed her.”</p><p>“No, on my honor, I swear,” declared my uncle. “They found her this morning, exactly as you see.”</p><p>“Do you think, then, that she did it of her own  accord—that she put an end to herself? Oh, what a horrible end!”</p>",
  "page-363": "<p>“Perhaps,” said Lerne. “However, there is another solution, and a more likely one. A supreme convulsion, I think, twisted the chain. The body was sickly. Hydrophobia declared itself some days ago. I hide nothing from you, Nicolas. I am not exculpating myself in any way. You can see that.”</p><p>“Oh,” I cried, in terror, “rabies.”</p><p>Lerne went on quietly, “It is possible, also, that another reason for this death escapes us. They found the dog at 8 o’clock this morning still warm. The death had taken place an hour before, and,” added he, “Macbeth succumbed at 7 o’clock—just at the same instant.”</p><p>“From what did he die?”</p><p>“He died of rabies also.”</p><hr class=\"section\">",

I had already observed similar signs of breaking health in my uncle, but this one was very clear evidence. I could observe all the details of it, and it was accompanied by curious circumstances; that is why I shall speak about it more particularly.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Any one who saw them and did not know all the</p>",
  "page-365": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">facts would have attributed those incidents to intellectual overwork. To tell the truth, my uncle did have spells of overwork. The laboratory, hothouse and <em>ch�teau</em> were no longer sufficient for him. He had annexed the park, also, and now Fonval bristled with complicated poles, abnormal masts, and unusual semaphores, and as some trees interfered with the experiments, a gang of woodcutters was sent for, in order to cut them down.</p><p>The joy of seeing the possibility of free passage to and fro restored in the grounds consoled  me for this sacrilegious destruction. All about the immense workshop of the valley basin one saw the Professor feverishly moving about from one building to another, from a dynamo to a switch, ferociously determined to suppress the fatal “attachment.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Sometimes, however, he had an attack of weakness, as the result of one of those very peculiar fainting-fits</p>",
  "page-366": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">which I am describing. It was always whilst he was reflecting profoundly, with his eyes fixed on some object or other, and brain working at high pressure that the attack came, and he collapsed. At such times he became paler and paler, until the color came back into his cheeks by itself, and by degrees.</p><p>Those attacks left him limp and without strength. They robbed him of his fine feeling of confidence, and I heard him complain after one of them, and murmur in a tone of discouragement:</p><p>“I’ll never succeed, never!”</p><p>Often had I been on the point of asking him about it. That day I made up my mind to do so.</p><p>We were drinking our coffee, Lerne seated in an armchair in front of the window, holding his cup in his hand. Our talk was a broken sort of conversation, with longer and longer intervals.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">For want of something to talk about, the</p>",
  "page-367": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">conversation  languished. Gradually it ceased altogether, as a fire goes out for want of fuel.</p><p>The clock struck, and one saw the woodcutters going to their work, with their axes over their shoulder. They brought before my mind a picture of ragged lictors going to carry out an execution of trees.</p><p>Which amongst my old comrades would perish to-day—this beech, or that chestnut? I saw them from my window, clothed in all the yellows of autumn, from the deepest copper to the palest gold, each showing its dark touch of shade, or its reddish light amongst those various yellows.</p><p>The firs were beginning to get black. Leaves were falling here and there as seemed good to themselves, for there was no breeze.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">With a spire like that of a cathedral, a poplar colossus with a hoary head dominated the leafage. I had always known it thus—a monumental tree—and the sight of it</p>",
  "page-368": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">stirred in me the memories of my childhood.</p><p>Suddenly a flight of terror-struck birds escaped from it—two rooks left it, cawing, a squirrel jumped from branch to branch, and took refuge on the neighboring walnut tree.</p><p>Some unpleasant creature, climbing into the tree, had doubtless threatened their safety. I could not distinguish it, for a clump of bushes hid all the lower part of the poplar, but with a  surprise that was almost pain I saw it quiver from the top to the roots, shake itself once or twice, and slowly sway its branches. One would have said that a breeze had sprung up which blew for it alone.</p><p>I thought of the woodcutters, without, however, forming a very precise conception of the part they might be playing in this drama.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Can my uncle,” I said to myself, “have ordered them to execute the poplar—that venerable</p>",
  "page-369": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">patriarch—that king of Fonval? That would be too much.”</p><p>Then, as I was on the point of asking Lerne about the matter, I perceived that he was in one of his fainting-fits.</p><p>I satisfied myself of the presence of the distinctive symptoms of his trouble, the immobility—the pallor—the fixed look—and I succeeded in determining what he was looking at with that persistent fixed stare of a somnambulist.</p><p>What he was gazing at was the poplar—that <em>animate</em> tree, whose appearance at the moment was recalling in so terrifying a way the date trees of the hothouse excited by love and battle.</p><p>I remembered the note-book. Was there not some appalling analogy between the <em>absence</em> of that man and the life of that tree?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Suddenly an ax smote the trunk with a sound as of</p>",
  "page-370": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">low thunder. The poplar quivered,  twisted about, and my uncle gave a start. His cup dropping from his hand, was dashed to pieces on the floor, and whilst his cheeks regained their color, he put his hand down quickly to his ankles, as if the ax had struck the man and the tree at the same blow.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lerne gradually recovered. I pretended to have observed nothing except his fainting, and I told him that he should look after himself—that those repeated fits would end by killing him. Did he know what caused them?</p><p>My uncle gave a sign that he did. Emma came near his chair.... “I know,” said he, at last, “cardiac <em>syncope</em>. I am treating myself.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">That was not true. The Professor was not treating himself. He was using up his life in the pursuit of his chimera, without more heed for his skin than it if had been an old work-jacket, to be thrown away as soon as</p>",
  "page-371": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the task was over.</p><p>Emma advised him to go out.</p><p>“The air will do you good,” she said.</p><p>He went out. We saw him going towards the poplar, smoking his pipe. The blows of the ax fell faster and faster. The tree bent over and fell. Its fall made the sound like an earthquake. The branches hit my uncle but he did not step aside.</p><p>And now, robbed of its only <em>campanile</em>, Fonval seemed to have sunk lower than ever into the  depths of the valley, and I sought, in the forlorn sky, to fix the place of the tree, which one had already forgotten, and its tall form, which was already legendary.</p><p>Lerne came back. He did not seem to know that he had been imprudent. His carelessness made one tremble when one realized that he might be as reckless in the most hazardous experiments—for example, those transfusions of soul about which the note-book spoke.</p>",
  "page-372": "<p>Was it one of those attempts which I had just witnessed? I meditated about it, with that strange feeling which I had already experienced at Fonval, like that caused by groping about in mysterious darkness.</p><p>Were Lerne’s fainting-fit and the tragedy of the tree some mysterious coincidence, or had some strange bond united them at the moment of the ax’s blow?</p><p>Certainly the arrival of the woodcutters at the foot of the poplar would have been enough to cause the flight of the birds, and as for the shuddering, why should the cutter not have produced it by climbing up the other side of the trunk in order to fix the traditional rope?</p><p>Once more, the crossways of probability offered me a choice of solutions, like so many roads, but my mind was not acute at the time.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I was often with Emma, but as much as I loved those meetings, I had to make up my mind to stop them, for</p>",
  "page-373": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the following unanswerable reason—but for the note-book I might have attributed it to my nervous condition; I should then have called it a pathological consequence of the operations, and Lerne would have fooled me to the end—fortunately I guessed his tactics at the first.</p><p>He had confided to me that he was thinking of assuming my shape, in order to be loved in my place. His eagerness to save my mutilated body; the method he had explained in the note-book, and the business of the poplar—all coordinated themselves in my mind. His fainting-fits assumed all the appearance of experiments, in which Lerne, through a sort of hypnotism, flung his soul into other beings.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">So now with his eye to the keyhole he watched every move I made, transfusing his <em>ego</em> into my brain, using the power which his unfinished discovery procured him, to put in practice the most astounding</p>",
  "page-374": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">substitution of personalities. I shall be told that this very appearance of unlikeliness ought to have weakened the value of my reasoning; but at Fonval, incoherence being the rule, the more absurd an explanation was, the more likely it was to be the right one.</p><p>Ah! that eye at the keyhole. It pursued me like that of Jehovah blasting Cain from the top  of its triangular peephole! I was never free of it. Emma felt my distress, but she was far from understanding the real cause of it.</p><p>Although I am joking now, I had perceived my danger, and my one thought was how to avert it. After long deliberation, I determined to take the only reasonable course—one which I should have taken long before, viz., departure. Departure with Emma, of course, for now nothing in the world would have made me leave to my uncle what I had won.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But Emma was not one of those women whom one can carry off against her will. Would she consent to</p>",
  "page-375": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">leave Lerne, and the promised wealth? Assuredly not!</p><p>The poor girl did not see this modernized form of fairy-tale going on around her. The glories to come completely occupied her mind. She was both silly and avaricious. To make her follow me I should have to make her believe that she would not be worse off by a penny, and it was only Lerne who could reassure her effectively on that score.</p><p>So, what I required was the Professor’s consent! Certainly there could be no question of any consent except of one sort; only one wrested from him by constant intimidation would serve the purpose.</p><p>I would make play with Macbeth’s murder, and  Klotz’s assassination, and my terrified uncle would speak to Emma as I wanted him to, and I should carry her off, no doubt depriving Mr. Nicolas Vermont of an inheritance (very much eaten into), and Mlle.

But the motor-car, of all things, exerted its magic over the magician, so in spite of the bad result obtained in the same conditions some months before, I had to make up my mind to speak to him during the journey in my 80 h. p., and should have done so—but for the <em>accident</em>.</p><p>It took place in the woods of Lourcq, three kilometers this side of Grey, as we were coming back to Fonval from a run to Vouziers.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">We were climbing a slight hill at full speed. My uncle was driving. I was going over in my mind the speech which I was going to make, and was repeating to myself for the hundredth time the phrases which I had prepared some time before, while apprehension dried up my tongue. Ever since our setting-out, I had put off the attack on my tyrant from moment to moment—rehearsing the firm tone which would intimidate him. Before each turn in the road I had said to myself, “It is</p>",
  "page-380": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">there I shall speak,” but we had passed  through all the villages, and gone round all the turns in the road, without my being able to articulate a syllable, and now I had hardly ten minutes left!</p><p>Well, I should open fire when we got to the top of the incline.</p><p>My first phrase was ready at the gates of my memory, and was awaiting expression, when the car lurched alarmingly towards the right, then towards the left, skidding on its two side wheels.</p><p>We were going to overturn!</p><p>I seized the wheel, and put on all the brake I could, with feet and hands. The car gradually came under control, again slackened its speed, and stopped right at the top of the hill.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Then I looked at Lerne. He was leaning out of his seat, his head nodding from side to side, and his eyes staring vacantly behind his spectacles. One of his arms</p>",
  "page-381": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">was hanging down.</p><p>A fainting-fit! We had had a narrow escape; so, those fainting-fits were really <em>syncope</em>. What had I been imagining with my silly ideas?</p><p>However, my uncle was not coming to. When I took off his mask, I saw that his clean-shaven face was as pale as a wax candle. His ungloved hands too looked as if they were of wax. I took them, and being quite ignorant of medicine, I slapped them vigorously, as one does to actresses, for hysterics.</p><p>This form of applause was in the nature of a <em>claque</em> in the repose of the countryside—sonorous and funereal; it greeted the withdrawal of the great charlatan from the stage.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \"><em>Fr�d�ric Lerne had indeed ceased to live.</em> I perceived it from his chilled fingers—from his livid cheeks, his soulless eye, and his heart, which had stopped beating.

  "page-382": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">had been so skeptical, had just put an end to his life, as is the way with those diseases, without any warning.</p><p>Stupefaction, and the reaction from the narrow shave I had just had, kept me motionless. So, in a second, there remained nothing of Lerne except food for worms, and a name fit for oblivion!</p><p>Nothing! in spite of my hatred for this detestable man, and my relief at knowing that he no longer had power to harm me, I was awestruck by the swift death which had spirited away this monster’s intelligence.</p><p>Like a puppet deprived of the hand that gave it life, and prostrate on the edge of the stage, Lerne lay stretched out, limp, his arm hanging down, and his funereal Pierrot’s face made whiter by Death.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And yet, as the spirit departed from it into the Unknown, the dead body of my uncle seemed to me to grow more beautiful.

  "page-383": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">seeing the latter become beautiful at the departure of the former. I followed the progress of the phenomenon on Lerne’s features. The Great Mystery shed the light of a divine serenity over his brow, as if life were a cloud whose passing reveals some strange sun; and thus whilst the countenance took on the hue of white marble, the puppet became a statue.</p><p>Tears dimmed my eyes. I took off my hat. If my uncle had perished fifteen years before, in the fullness of happiness and wisdom, that Lerne of long ago could not have been more beautiful to see.</p><p>But I could not go on dreaming in this way, keeping up a conversation with a corpse on a frequented road. So I raised him in my arms calmly, deliberately, and placed him on my left; a strap from the grid fixed him firmly in the seat.

My uncle, with his hair carefully parted, had been clothed in a frilled shirt, and a white tie. His pale hands were clasped together, and held a rosary. A crucifix showed like a star on his breast. His knees and feet stood out under the sheets like sharp snowy hills, very far away.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">On the night-table, behind the bowl, in which there was no Holy Water, and in which lay useless a sprinkler</p>",

He came, and handed me this letter, which I have preserved, and whose criss-crossed paper, bespattered with blots and blobs of ink, I now pin on to my piece of white paper:</p><blockquote class=\"  \"><p>“Dear Nick,\n“Pardon me for the pain I am causing you, but it is better that we should part. I found again yesterday, my first lover Alcide, the man I fought with L�onie about. He is the</blockquote>",

I could not give up that kind of life, except for the sort of money which Lerne promised me. I should have made you unhappy, and should have been unfaithful to you. All the rest amounts to nothing. I want a real man. It is not your fault, and so I hope this will not cause you any pain. Adieu for life.\n“Emma Bourdichet.”</p></blockquote><p>In the presence of so categorical an intimation, couched in jargon almost as barbarous as that of the Law Courts, I could only bow to fate. Moreover, were not those sentiments which Emma was  expressing, exactly those which had charmed me in her? Had I not loved in her just that thirst for pleasure which was the cause of her bewitching beauty, and the cause of her infidelity?</p><p>I had the energy and wisdom to defer the rest of my reflections until the morrow. They might have brought on weakness in action.</p>",

Together we went to the garage.</p><p>The car had disappeared!</p><p>It can easily be imagined that I put the two treasonable acts together, and accused Emma of a secret complicity.</p><p>But the Manager of the Hotel, thinking he had to do with audacious thieves, went off to the police-office. He came back, saying that they had found in a little street of the <em>faubourg</em>, a car with the number 234XY, which had been abandoned, as he thought, by thieves, for want of petrol. The tank was empty.</p><p>“Ah! just so,” said I to myself. Klotz wanted to run away. He forgot about the exhaustion of the petrol, and there he is, paralyzed.</p>",
